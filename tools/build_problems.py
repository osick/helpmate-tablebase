"""Build the per-material problem data the static site reads.

    python3 tools/build_problems.py --tables ~/tb [--binary ./build/helpmate]
                                    [--out site/data] [--material KQvk ...]

Run by hand against a corpus, like tools/build_site_data.py -- the output is
committed, because the Pages workflow has no tables.

Two classes of problem per material:

  unique  the deepest positions with exactly one optimal solution
  duals   the deepest positions with exactly two, which differ in both their
          first and their last move (starts = ends = count = 2)

The depths come from the sidecar's `uniqueness` map and are exact, so no
scanning is needed to find them. Only the positions themselves are mined.
`mine --jsonl --themes --solutions` returns fen, dtm, count, starts, ends,
themes and the SAN solutions in one call, so a material costs about two
subprocess invocations for mining, plus one `probe` and one `line --all`
re-check per selected problem (see reprobe, reprobe_lines) -- up to twelve
more, since each of up to six selected problems needs both.

Note that the strict dual filter is usually empty at the deepest dual depth --
the two solutions there almost always share a first or a last move -- so the
search walks depths downward and typically lands one ply shallower. Both
depths are recorded; the page states the difference.
