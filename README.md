# helpmate-tablebase

**Every helpmate in a material class, solved exhaustively.** Not a solver you
point at one position — a table that already knows the answer for all of them.

Complete through five pieces. MIT licensed. The tables are a free download.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **631 six-piece tablebases have never been computed, and 281 of them need
> only 32 GiB of RAM and about a day of CPU each.** If you have a machine that
> idles overnight, you can compute something nobody ever has — and get credited

```
$ helpmate mine KQvk --dtm 2 --count 1 --max 3
8/8/8/8/8/8/8/k1KQ4 b - - 0 1
8/8/8/8/8/2Q5/8/k1K5 b - - 0 1
8/8/8/8/4Q3/8/8/k1K5 b - - 0 1
```

Those are h#1 positions with **exactly one** solution — sound compositions,
enumerated rather than found. That is what this is for.

## What a helpmate is

Both sides cooperate. Black moves first and *helps* White deliver mate in the
fewest possible moves. Composers publish these as `h#n` problems: a position
plus a claim that mate is reachable in exactly `n` moves, ideally by a
**unique** solution — a second solution is usually a flaw.

Because both sides want the same thing, solving is a cooperative
shortest-path problem rather than the min/max game tree an ordinary tablebase
faces. That is what makes whole material classes tractable instead of one
position at a time.

For every legal position in a class, the table stores:

- **dtm** — distance to mate in plies, under optimal cooperation.
- **h#n** — the composer's notation, derived from dtm.
- **count** — how many *distinct* optimal solutions tie for shortest.
  `count=1` is a sound composition. `count=2` is a dual.

That last field is the point. Anyone can search for a mate; the tablebase
tells you whether it is **unique**, across every position at once.

## Sixty seconds

```console
$ helpmate gen KQvk --tables tables
tables/Kvk.hm max_dtm=255
tables/KQvk.hm max_dtm=14

$ helpmate probe "8/7k/5K2/8/8/8/8/6Q1 b - - 0 1"
dtm=2 (h#1) count=4

$ helpmate line "8/7k/5K2/8/8/8/8/6Q1 b - - 0 1" --all
Kh6 Qh2#
Kh6 Qh1#
Kh6 Qg6#
Kh8 Qg7#
```

Black king h7, White king f6, White queen g1. Mate in one move each — and
four different ways to do it, so as a composition it is unsound. The table
answered in constant time; it did no search.

Generation is a one-off cost. Every query afterwards is a table lookup.

## What is solved today

| pieces | classes | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2–4 | 66 | **complete** |
| 5 | 220 | **complete** |
| 6 | 645 | 14 done, 631 to go |
| 7+ | — | needs an out-of-core generator that does not exist |

**300 tables, 50.2 GiB** block-compressed, published as a Hugging Face
dataset. The deepest mate in the corpus is h#17.

[**The deepest sound problem in every material class →**](docs/DEEPEST.md)

**Or on a board:** [osick.github.io/helpmate-tablebase](https://osick.github.io/helpmate-tablebase/) — the deepest sound problems played through, 930 unique-solution puzzles to solve, and the corpus table by table. Static, no server, built from the same data.
One position per material, with a diagram and its solution — and a link that
opens each one in the [Helpmate Analyzer](https://helpman.komtera.lt/) with the
stipulation already set. The same data is typeset as a print booklet:
`make booklet`.

```bash
helpmate-tables pull --tables ./tables --repo osick/helpmate-tables
```

The server can also stream tables on demand instead, fetching and caching
each class the first time someone asks for it.

## Help solve the rest

Six hundred machine-days of work remain at six pieces, and it will not come
from one desk.

**281 of the missing tables need only 32 GiB of RAM** and about a day each.
If you have a machine that idles overnight, you can compute something nobody
ever has. Contributions land as pull requests on the dataset, and every
merged table is credited.

Two pieces of tooling are also wanted and would help more than any table: a
`helpmate verify` command, and `--create-pr` support in the push CLI. Both
are described in that guide.

## The command line is the front door

`helpmate` is the primary interface, and
**[USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)** documents all of it:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `gen` | build every table a material class needs |
| `probe` | look up one position |
| `line` | print optimal solutions as SAN |
| `mine` | scan a class for compositions by dtm, solution count, shape and theme; annotate, export as JSON, or refine interactively |
| `stats` | generation statistics and corpus summaries |
| `themes` | list the pattern detectors `mine --theme` accepts |
| `compact` | compress tables, or shrink provably-unsolvable ones to markers |

`mine --theme` recognises named composition patterns — model mates, echoes,
battery mates and more. The **[theme catalogue](docs/THEME-CATALOG.md)** has
the full list with the exact definition each detector uses.

## Mining, from a scan to a shortlist

`mine` is where compositions come from, and since 0.18.0 a scan is something
you can hold on to rather than a stream of FENs you have to probe one by one.

**Annotate every hit.** `--themes` adds the themes each position shows,
`--solutions` adds every optimal solution. Text stays greppable: the FEN is
the only unindented line.

```console
$ helpmate mine KRvkb --dtm 6 --max 1 --themes --solutions --tables ~/tb
8/8/8/8/8/8/8/K1k1bR2 b - - 0 1
  themes: pure model ideal mirror switchback single-piece single-piece:black nocheck
  Kd1 Ka2 Kc1 Kb3 Kb1 Rxe1#
  Kc2 Ka2 Kc1 Kb3 Kb1 Rxe1#
  Kd2 Ka2 Kc1 Kb3 Kb1 Rxe1#
```

**Take everything.** `--max infinity` (or `inf`) lifts the cap, and `--json`
turns the result into one document with the material, the filter that was
asked, and a `positions` array carrying `fen`, `dtm`, `count` and, with the
flags above, `themes`, `starts`, `ends` and `solutions`. For a result too
big to parse in one piece, `--jsonl` writes the same records one per line,
streamed as the scan finds them, between a header line and a footer line
with the counts:

```console
$ helpmate mine KRvkb --dtm 6 --max infinity --json --themes --solutions --tables ~/tb > krvkb-h3.json
$ helpmate mine KRvkb --dtm 6 --max infinity --jsonl --themes --tables ~/tb | jq -c 'select(.fen and (.themes|index("ideal")))'
```

**Refine instead of rescanning.** `--interactive` runs the scan once, keeps
the hits in memory, and opens a prompt. Narrowing by theme, solution count
or shape works on the held set; each position's themes and solutions are
computed the first time they are needed and cached, so `back` is free and
a second filter on the same set costs nothing.

![A mine --interactive session: a theme histogram over 2000 KRvkb h#3 positions, narrowed to 53 unique model mates, one shown with its solution, the set saved as JSON](docs/images/mine-shell.png)

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `theme NAME`, `not theme NAME` | keep or drop positions showing NAME (`promotions:qrr` works too) |
| `count N`, `starts N`, `ends N` | keep positions with exactly that value |
| `back`, `reset` | undo the last narrowing, or return to the loaded set |
| `list [FROM [N]]`, `show I` | page through the FENs; print one hit with its themes and every solution |
| `themes` | how many positions in the current set show each theme, the map for what to narrow on next |
| `save FILE` | `.json` writes the document above, `.jsonl` the JSON Lines form; anything else writes bare FENs |
| `help`, `quit` | |

Results go to stdout and the prompt, progress and notes to stderr, so a
scripted session (`helpmate mine ... --interactive < script > out`) leaves a
clean file. There is no line editing built in; `rlwrap helpmate ...` adds
history. The whole thing is in [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#mine--scan-for-composition-candidates),
with the JSON keys and the exact text layout.

### Also available

- **Python.** `from helpmate import Tablebase` — probe, enumerate lines, and
  mine from a script. See [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#python-api).
- **HTTP API and web dashboard.** `helpmate-server` serves a read-only JSON
  API and a browser board for exploring positions. Secondary to the CLI, and
  documented in [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#api-server).

## Why you can trust it

A tablebase is worth exactly as much as your reason to believe it. This one
does not grade its own homework:

- **An independent oracle** — a from-scratch cooperative search sharing only
  the move generator with the real generator — re-solves sampled positions
  from every slice and checks both dtm and solution count.
- **Every one of the 368,452 legal `KQvk` positions** is cross-checked against
  a reference implementation written directly on python-chess, with no
  helpmate code involved in computing the expected answers.
- **Multithreaded output is required to be byte-identical** to
  single-threaded output, and that is asserted, not assumed.

[INTERNALS.md](docs/INTERNALS.md) has the full account, including measured
coverage and one unresolved bug stated plainly rather than buried.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osick/helpmate-tablebase
cd helpmate-tablebase
