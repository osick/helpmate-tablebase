# Install all three distributions from this tree, in dependency order:
# helpmate-api requires helpmate, and nothing is on PyPI yet, so installing
# them out of order sends pip looking for the name upstream.
#
# If this hangs with no output and no error: see docs/BUILD.md's entry with
# that exact symptom. Short version: pip's isolated build env inherits HOME,
# so if ~/.gitconfig rewrites https://github.com/ to git@github.com:, CMake
# FetchContent's clone goes over SSH and can pop an invisible GUI passphrase
# dialog. Not hardcoded here because it would also disable legitimate global
# config (proxies, credential helpers); opt in per-invocation instead --
# GNU Make exports command-line variable assignments to the recipe's
# environment automatically, so this needs no plumbing in the recipe itself:
#   make install GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null

# `node --check` on a plain `.js` file does automatic CommonJS/ESM detection:
# it tries a CJS parse first, and as soon as it hits the file's first
# `import`/`export` it concludes "this is a module" and stops validating --
# it does NOT then fully parse the rest of the file as ESM. Every dashboard
# JS file has its first import/export within the first ~9 lines, so a syntax
# error anywhere after that point is silently accepted (verified: an
# unterminated string appended to a copy of each file still exits 0 as
# `.js`, but exits 1 -- correctly -- once the same content is checked as
# `.mjs`, which forces unambiguous ESM parsing). So each file is copied to a
# temp `.mjs` path and checked there. Names are flattened (not just
# basename) so js/foo.js and js/lib/foo.js can't collide, and node's error
# output -- which names the temp path, not the real one -- has the temp path
# substituted back to the real source path before printing.
# `git ls-files` alone only lists tracked files, so a brand-new .js dropped
# into the tree and never `git add`-ed is invisible to it -- lint would exit
# 0 having checked nothing of the new file. `--others --exclude-standard`
# adds untracked-but-not-.gitignore'd files to the tracked set, so a new
# module is checked before it is ever staged.
