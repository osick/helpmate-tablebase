// Fixed groups, each introduced by a sentence before its members. Read off
// every theme's own `doc` string in the live registry (src/core/themes/
// registry.cpp) rather than assumed from memory -- the first version of
// this table named 11 of the build's then 22 registered motifs and left the
// other 11 to fall into "other" wholesale. All 24 group cleanly into the
// five below; nothing should land in "other" on a build that still matches
// this registry.
//
// A name the API returns that is not listed in any group here still falls
// into the trailing "other" group instead of being dropped -- see
// renderThemes() below, which never special-cases an unrecognised name,
// only ones it recognises. That is what lets a future motif appear on this
// screen with no edit to this file, and it is exactly the behaviour that
// caught this table's own first-draft gap.
