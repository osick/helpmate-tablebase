// For an en-passant capture the victim actually stands BESIDE `p.to` (see

// correct for that. Deliberate, not an oversight: `p.to` is where the
// capturing unit ends up, and kniest asks whether the king is later mated on
// that square, which is well-defined for ep captures too. Behaviour is
// unchanged; this is a documented reading, not a bug.
