# Theme selection -- every theme, grouped by the machinery it needs

Generated from `docs/THEME-CATALOG.md` on 2026-08-08. That file assigns each
theme a feasibility tier; this one regroups the same **295** themes by *what
would have to be built*, which is the axis that matters when choosing what to
implement next.

Nothing here is a commitment, and no grouping has been validated by writing a
detector. The glossary (<https://helpman.komtera.lt/themes.html>) is the
authority on what each name means; the notes are this project's own assessment
of what a detector would need.

## DONE -- Already shipped  (16)

Sixteen of the glossary's names. Four more shipped detectors -- `pure`, `underpromotion`, `nocapture` and `nocheck` -- are **not** glossary entries, so they do not appear anywhere in this document; that is 20 detectors, 24 registry entries counting the colour variants.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| BK moves only | A | implemented as single-piece:black |
| Closed walk | A | implemented |
| En passant | A | implemented; the format supports ep exactly |
| Excelsior | A | implemented |
| Ideal mate | A | implemented |
| Kniest theme | A | implemented |
| Mirror mate | A | implemented |
| Model mate | A | implemented |
| Pendulum | A | implemented |
| Phoenix | A | implemented |
| Promotion | A | implemented |
| Schnoebelen theme | A | implemented |
| Self-block | A | implemented |
| Set play | A | implemented; needs: plane (answers on saturated positions without enumerating solutions) |
| Switchback | A | implemented |
| Zajic theme | A | implemented |

## A1 -- Diagram only -- no solutions needed  (5)

Readable from the starting position alone. Note corrected 2026-08: this does *not* run at "scan speed" -- evaluating a diagram theme still requires materialising the position (decode + `Board::from_pieces`), so the floor is decode speed, not scan speed. What it does deliver is answering on saturated positions where every solutions-needing theme today gives up.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Homebase | A | built and then **removed** 2026-08: the tablebase index quotients positions by a symmetry group (see `src/core/indexing/kk.cpp`), and Homebase is not invariant under it -- a cell stores an equivalence class, not a position, so the answer would depend on which mirror representative was decoded. A `Needs::Position` theme must be invariant under the index's symmetry group, or it cannot be mined at all; Homebase is the only one of the four in this group known to fail that test |
| Kindergarten problem | A | material of the diagram |
| Obtrusive piece | A | static reading of the diagram's pawn structure |
| Promoted force | A | static reading of the diagram |
| Skittles | A | the diagram alone |

## A2 -- Mating position only  (4)

Needs one solution, but only its last ply and final board -- not the whole set.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Blocking piece replacement | A | diagram against mating board on one flight square |
| Home-coming | A | mating board against the game-array squares |
| Mating piece | A | the last ply's mover; battery cases are genuinely ambiguous | Y |
| Mating square | A | the last ply's destination, or the mated king's square | Y |

## A3 -- The other side-to-move plane (set play)  (2)

One O(1) table lookup. Cheap here precisely because both side-to-move planes are stored, and awkward for an analyser that has to search.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Apparent mate | A | the other plane of the diagram mates in one |
| Short set play | A | the other plane, at a shorter distance |

## A4 -- Within one solution -- plies, captures, promotions  (38)

Exactly the pattern of the eight ply-detectors already shipped. No new machinery of any kind.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 100 Dollar theme | A | white and black excelsior with knight promotions, all inside one solution |
| Active sacrifice | A | a unit moves to a square where a later ply captures it |
| Amazon theme | A | every white ply moved by the queen |
| Annihilation | A | capture then vacate; the "positive effect" qualifier stays approximate |
| Artificial castling | A | ordinary moves onto the post-castling squares; no castling rights involved |
| Balbo theme | A | piece types of the movers, ply by ply |
| Bukovina theme | A | attack count on a flight, its capture, a later self-block there |
| Closed chain of Umnov | A | every ply lands on a just-vacated square |
| Consecutive checks | A | the is_check flag |
| Consecutive Umnov | A | from/to chain |
| Crosscheck | A | check answered by a non-capturing check |
| Crusader theme | A | every white ply by one knight |
| Cycle of captures | A | capture chain inside one solution |
| Delayed Umnov | A | square history inside one solution |
| Distant self-block | A | self-block plus the king field of the square the king reaches |
| Durbar theme | A | every white ply by the king |
| Feather 2 theme | A | sacrifice in the king field, pawn capture, self-block |
| Feather theme | A | move paths crossing the initial black king square |
| Festina lente | A | two single steps from a pawn's home square |
| FML | A | repeated arrival on the square one enemy unit just left |
| Helsinki theme | A | sacrifice then two vacations, all inside one solution |
| Hyvinkaa theme | A | every ply of one solution lands on one square |
| Kozhakin theme | A | first and last white ply on the same square |
| Meerane theme | A | first and last ply compared inside one solution |
| Mihajloski theme | A | collinear order swapped twice inside one solution |
| Mixed Phoenix | A | capture on a promotion square, then a like promotion |
| Monkey theme | A | the two sides' move sequences compared |
| Nissl theme | A | sacrifice, then promotion to the same type |
| Oudot task | A | three black queen promotions in one solution; the table could settle it for reachable material |
| Pawn-Zajic | A | Zajic with a pawn as the capturing unit |
| Slow Excelsior | A | excelsior that opens with a single step |
| Square-clearance by capture | A | capture, vacate, enemy unit follows onto the square |
| Super Durbar | A | both sides move only their kings |
| Umnov mate | A | mate on the square a black unit just left |
| Umnov move | A | any arrival on a just-vacated square |
| Unblocking sacrifice | A | capture, vacate, enemy unit captures on the square |
| White Kniest theme | A | capture on the square the white king later occupies |
| White Zajic theme | A | from/to and captures beside the white king |

## A5 -- Within one solution -- trajectory shape  (9)

Shape predicates over one unit's path. `themes::trajectories()` already exists and already chains plies per unit.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Areal cycle | A | one unit's trajectory |
| Corner-to-corner | A | one from/to, or one unit's trajectory |
| Cyclic place exchange | A | trajectory endpoints inside one solution |
| Linear cycle | A | one unit's trajectory |
| Long-trip | A | one officer moving three or more times |
| Place exchange | A | trajectory endpoints inside one solution |
| Staircase | A | trajectory shape |
| Wigwag | A | a slider recrossing its own start square along one line |
| Zigzag | A | trajectory shape |

## A6 -- Set operations the catalogue tiered as A  (2)

Genuinely need the whole solution set despite the tier, so they arrive with the B1 signature rather than before it.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Asymmetry | A | axis symmetry of the diagram, then a mirror test per solution |
| Mates on same square | A | group solutions by the last ply's destination |

## A7 -- Not a theme  (1)

Kept so the arithmetic reconciles.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Helpmate | A | the stipulation itself, not a theme |

## B1 -- Across the solution set -- the tier-B unlock  (59)

**All of these come from one change**: a detector signature over `std::vector<Solution>` instead of a single `Solution`. `solutions()` already returns the set. For a helpmate a "phase" is one optimal solution, which is what puts this whole tier within reach.

| Zilahi | B | captured in one phase, mating in the other |

## B2 -- Set play compared against the solution  (3)

Needs A3's plane lookup *and* the solution set.

| Larsson theme | B | final boards of set play and solution compared |
| Loewenton theme | B | promotion types swapped between set play and solution |

## C1 -- Extra probing  (20)

Needs positions other than the one asked about: swapped move orders, skipped moves, removed units, mates that must be shown not to work. Each probe is O(1) here, which is why this family is cheap for a tablebase and hard for a searching analyser. Breaks the current rule that a detector never touches the table.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Bukovinszky theme | C | set play plus two "threatened" mates that only a probe can confirm |
| Bukovinszky-Garai theme | C | same machinery, one mate deeper |

| Dual avoidance | C | probe the mate that does not work |

| Lindner 2 theme | C | set-play "threats" that only a probe can confirm |

| Stocchi blocks | C | repeated blocks plus dual avoidance |
| Tempo maneuver | C | probe the position with the moves skipped |
| Tempo move | C | probe the position with the move skipped |

## E1 -- Twinning  (4)

Needs a modified diagram -- often a table already generated, but it needs its own vocabulary first.

| Theme | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Changed motivation | E | a twin whose solution is unchanged |
| Forsberg twins | E | twinning by changing a piece's type |
| Striptease theme | E | successive twins made by removal |
| Zagoruiko theme | E | three twins with changed mates; the solution-group variant is B |

## D1 -- Motif engine -- blocked  (96)

Needs line-piece geometry the project has no notion of: pins, half-pins, interference, batteries, critical squares, clearance, doubling, unpinning. One piece of machinery rather than 96 separate problems, but a large one, and none of it exists.
