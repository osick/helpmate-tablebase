# Theme catalogue: what this project could detect

Every one of the **295 themes** named in the [Helpmate Analyzer
glossary](https://helpman.komtera.lt/themes.html) (Viktoras Paliulionis),
classified against what a tablebase can actually compute. The glossary is the
authority for what each name *means*; the tier is this project's own
assessment of its own machinery, written 2026-08-03 against v0.8.0. Nothing
here is a promise that a theme will be implemented, and no tier assignment has
been validated by writing the detector — a tier is a claim about which
*primitives* a detector would need, not about how hard the detector is.

The claim worth making up front is narrow. A tablebase is not a better
analyser than a single-problem analyser; it is a different one. It knows every
optimal solution of a position without searching, it knows both sides-to-move
planes of every position it stores, and it can answer any other legal position
of the same material in O(1). That makes a small family of themes — set play,
move-order choice, dual avoidance, tempo — cheap here and awkward elsewhere.
It does nothing at all for the large family of themes built on line geometry,
where the analyser's vocabulary (pin, interference, battery, critical square)
is exactly what this project lacks.

## What a detector can see today

A detector is a pure function of a `Solution` (`src/core/probe/solution.h`):
the starting board, and per ply the mover, from/to, captured type, promotion
type, en-passant and check flags, and the full board after the ply.
`themes::trajectories()` chains plies into per-unit paths;
`themes::attackers_of()` and `themes::king_field()` give square-attack counts
and the king's field. There is no notion of a line of action, a pin, or a
piece supporting another. Two format facts bound the catalogue permanently:
**castling is not supported** (`Board::from_fen` rejects castling rights) and
**en passant is** (exactly, folded in at generation and probe time).

## Tiers

- **A — computable now, no new machinery.** Readable from a single position,
  from the already-stored second (side-to-move) plane, or as a set/count
  operation over the solutions `solutions()` already returns.
- **B — cross-solution comparison.** Solutions compared against each other
  using only facts already in `Ply`/`Solution`/`trajectories()`. No
  line-geometry analysis.
- **C — extra tablebase probing.** Computable only by querying positions
  *other* than the one asked about: swapped move orders, skipped moves,
  removed units, mates that must be shown not to work. Cheap here because a
  probe is O(1); genuinely expensive for a searching analyser.
- **D — strategic-motif engine.** Needs line-piece geometry the project has no
  notion of: pins, half-pins, interference, batteries, critical squares,
  clearance, doubling, unpinning.
- **E — twinning.** Needs a modified diagram — a piece changed, moved, added
  or removed. Often a table the project has already generated, but it needs
  its own vocabulary before it can be asked for.
- **X — impossible or out of scope.** Requires castling (permanently
  impossible), needs retro-analysis, or is a composer- or tourney-specified
  pattern rather than a general theme.

Themes whose glossary entry is a bare cross-reference are tiered as their
target and marked "alias of X" in the note.

## Summary

| Tier | Themes | Share |
|---|---|---|
| A — computable now | 79 | 27% |
| B — cross-solution | 64 | 22% |
| C — extra probing | 21 | 7% |
| D — motif engine | 102 | 35% |
| E — twinning | 4 | 1% |
| X — out of scope | 25 | 8% |
| **Total** | **295** | |

A and B together are 142 themes — just under half — and neither needs anything
the codebase does not already have. D alone is 103 themes, and they are one
piece of machinery, not 103.

## The catalogue

Sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive), so it can be used as a lookup. The
note says why the tier, or what the theme needs; it is deliberately not a
paraphrase of the definition — follow the glossary link above for that.

Row count: **295**, one per glossary entry.

## What v0.8.0 already has

Sixteen registry entries (`src/core/themes/registry.cpp`) cover twelve themes;
four exist in both a broad and a colour-specific form. Ten of the twelve carry
a glossary name:

| Registry entry | Glossary theme |
|---|---|
| `model` | Model mate |
| `ideal` | Ideal mate |
| `mirror` | Mirror mate |
| `promotion` | Promotion |
| `excelsior`, `excelsior:white`, `excelsior:black` | Excelsior |
| `switchback` | Switchback |
| `closed-walk` | Closed walk |
| `self-block` | Self-block |
| `single-piece:black` | BK moves only (with the king); also Durbar, Amazon, Crusader in their white forms |
| `en-passant` | En passant |

Two entries have no glossary counterpart: `pure` (the glossary defines pure
mate only inside its Model mate entry) and `underpromotion` (a move property,
not a named theme).

So the delta is **68 further tier-A themes** reachable with the primitives
already in `src/core/themes/`, before any new machinery at all.

## Where the value is

**Tier A, cheapest first.** Four clusters account for most of it, and each is
one shared helper plus a handful of registry entries:

- *Trajectory shapes* — Staircase, Zigzag, Pendulum, Linear cycle, Areal
  cycle, Long-trip, Corner-to-corner, Wigwag, Place exchange. All are
  predicates over `trajectories()`, which already exists and is already
  tested.
- *The Umnov family* — Umnov move, Umnov mate, Consecutive Umnov, Delayed
  Umnov, Closed chain of Umnov, FML. All are "did this ply land on a square
  something just left", one square-history walk shared between them.
- *The capture-and-square family* — Zajic, Pawn-Zajic, White Zajic, Kniest,
  White Kniest, Bukovina, Square-clearance by capture, Unblocking sacrifice,
  Active sacrifice, Annihilation. All from/to plus `captured` plus the mating
  square.
- *Pawn and promotion patterns inside one solution* — Phoenix, Mixed Phoenix,
  Nissl, Schnoebelen, Festina lente, Slow Excelsior, Oudot task, 100 Dollar
  theme. These are the ones where `mine()` earns its keep: a task like Oudot's
  is a search over a whole material class, which is exactly what this project
  does and a single-problem analyser cannot do at all.

**Tier B needs one abstraction, not sixty-four detectors.** Almost every
tier-B theme is the same shape: take the solution set as a set of *phases*,
project each phase to a small tuple (mover, from, to, promotion type, mating
square, captured unit, final board), and look for a permutation — identity,
swap, or cycle — across phases. Build that projection-and-permutation layer
once and Zilahi and its five relatives, the cycle themes, the changed and
exchanged themes, the Albino/Pickaninny/wheel unions, and the echo-mate
comparison all fall out as configurations of it. This is the single highest-
leverage piece of work in the catalogue: ~64 themes for one abstraction, with
no new chess knowledge required.

**Tier C is the differentiator, and it is small.** Twenty-one themes, all of
them "show that some *other* position does not work": move order, dual
avoidance, tempo, hideaway, the set-play threat themes. Each is a handful of
O(1) probes here and a fresh search elsewhere. Two of them (Hideaway,
Enabling hideaway) probe a position with a unit removed, which is a different
material and therefore a different table — cheap only if that table has been
generated.

**Tier D is one engine.** 103 themes — over a third of the glossary — need the
same missing layer: for each line piece, its lines of action; for each line,
which units lie on it and in what order; and from that, pin, half-pin,
interference, battery, critical square, clearance, doubling, guard line. That
is a single module of perhaps the size of `attack.cpp`, and it is the only
thing standing between this project and Grimshaw, Turton, Indian, Bristol,
the whole pin/unpin lattice, and the Zilahi variants that depend on
identifying a battery's rear piece. Nothing else in the catalogue comes close
to that ratio. It is also the point at which this project would stop being a
tablebase with theme labels and start being an analyser, which is a decision
about scope, not only about effort.

**Tier E is cheap but unclaimed.** Only four themes, but twinning is a
vocabulary the CLI and API do not have: naming a modified diagram, resolving
it to a material, and probing it. Worth doing when a twin-aware query surface
is wanted for its own sake, not for these four.

**Tier X will not move.** Three of the 25 are castling (Castling, Uncastling,
Valladao task) and one is retro-legality (Illegal position); those are
permanent. The other 21 are composer- or tourney-specified compounds
(Abdurahmanovic, Azemmour, Sabra, Onkoud, JT, WCCT). Some of them are
mechanically checkable — Azemmour 11 is a flight count — but they specify a
tournament's entry conditions rather than a general theme, and a general
engine is the wrong place for them.
